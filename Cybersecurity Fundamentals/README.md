\## Personal Reflection



This folder represents my foundation in cybersecurity, built through both traditional instruction and hands-on analysis. From configuring firewalls and reviewing threat reports to exploring the ethical implications of data access and regulation, these early courses shaped my approach to security as both a technical and human issue. Each assignment, whether hands-on or conceptual, brought me closer to the mindset and skills required for GRC and security auditing roles.
