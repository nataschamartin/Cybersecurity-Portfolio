## Overview
This course introduced methods for identifying and categorizing assets, threats, and vulnerabilities within an organization. It emphasized the use of compliance frameworks, structured worksheets, and risk assessment methodologies to evaluate and prioritize security risks.  

## Key Topics Covered
- Core asset types and their value to organizations  
- Threat categories and classification methods  
- Vulnerability identification and assessment  
- Access control evaluation and least privilege enforcement  
- PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) methodology  
- Building and maintaining a risk register  
- Conducting vulnerability assessments and documenting findings  
- Mapping compliance frameworks and security organizations  

## Practical Applications
- Completed an **Access Control Worksheet** to evaluate controls  
- Developed a **Controls and Compliance Checklist** mapped to frameworks  
- Applied **PASTA threat modeling** with worksheets (and optional diagrams)  
- Built a **Risk Register** scoring risks by impact and likelihood  
- Produced a **Vulnerability Assessment Report** with mitigation recommendations  
- Summarized major **Security Organizations** and their mandates  
- Applied the **PESTEL framework** to evaluate AI-related compliance risks  
- Documented multiple **Case Studies** (e.g., Home Depot, Pegasus Airlines, USB drop attack) to analyze real-world vulnerabilities and incidents  

## Personal Reflection
This course reinforced the importance of structured analysis in identifying risks and prioritizing remediation. By applying frameworks such as PASTA, PESTEL, and traditional compliance checklists, I gained hands-on experience producing the same deliverables used by security analysts in real-world governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) roles.
