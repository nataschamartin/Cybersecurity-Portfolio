\# Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities



\*\*Provider:\*\* IBM (Coursera, Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate)  



\## Overview

This section includes completed assignments and case studies focused on identifying assets, assessing threats, and evaluating vulnerabilities. Work completed here applies structured risk assessment methods, compliance checklists, and threat modeling frameworks (e.g., PASTA, PESTEL). These deliverables demonstrate the ability to analyze security risks in both theoretical and real-world contexts.  



\## Assignments

\- \*\*Access Control Worksheet\*\*  

&nbsp; Evaluates access control mechanisms and identifies potential gaps.  



\- \*\*Controls and Compliance Checklist\*\*  

&nbsp; Documents security controls mapped against compliance requirements.  



\- \*\*PASTA Worksheet\*\*  

&nbsp; Applies the Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis to assess threats and risks. Supporting diagrams (attack tree and data flow) available as supplemental visuals.  



\- \*\*Risk Register\*\*  

&nbsp; Identifies, categorizes, and prioritizes risks by impact and likelihood.  



\- \*\*Vulnerability Assessment Report\*\*  

&nbsp; Provides findings from a vulnerability assessment, including weaknesses and mitigation recommendations.  



\- \*\*Security Organizations Worksheet\*\*  

&nbsp; Summarizes global security organizations and their compliance mandates.  



\- \*\*PESTEL Framework and AI Analysis\*\*  

&nbsp; Applies Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal analysis to evaluate AI compliance risks.  



\## Case Studies

Applied real-world scenarios to reinforce concepts in threat and vulnerability analysis:  

\- \*\*Deep Fake\*\* – Social engineering risks using manipulated media.  

\- \*\*Equiniti\*\* – Third-party risk and data breach implications.  

\- \*\*23andMe Breach\*\* – Genetic data privacy and insider threat analysis.  

\- \*\*Home Depot Breach\*\* – Retail POS malware and vendor management failures.  

\- \*\*Lightning Strikes\*\* – Physical security and business continuity risks.  

\- \*\*Pegasus Airlines\*\* – Credential leaks and impact on transportation security.  

\- \*\*IBM X-Force Red Pen Test\*\* – Ethical hacking and penetration testing findings.  

\- \*\*USB Drop Exercise\*\* – Social engineering using physical device compromise.  



\## Personal Reflection

This body of work demonstrated how structured methods and case-based analysis strengthen risk assessment. By combining worksheets with real-world case studies, I gained practical experience documenting vulnerabilities, prioritizing risks, and applying compliance frameworks in ways directly relevant to GRC and incident response roles.
