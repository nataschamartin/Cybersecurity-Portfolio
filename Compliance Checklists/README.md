\# Compliance Checklists



\*\*Provider:\*\* IBM (Coursera, Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate)  

\*\*Folder Scope:\*\* Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities + Structured GRC Deliverables  



---



\## Overview



This folder contains structured assignments and real-world case studies aligned with governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) objectives. All documents reflect foundational cybersecurity practices including asset identification, risk prioritization, threat modeling, and compliance alignment. These deliverables showcase applied knowledge in risk management and preparedness for GRC-focused cybersecurity roles.

\## Case Studies



These applied scenarios reinforce core compliance and threat modeling concepts:



\- \*\*Deep Fake\*\* – Explores social engineering risks via synthetic media.

\- \*\*Equiniti\*\* – Analyzes third-party risk and vendor breach response.

\- \*\*23andMe Breach\*\* – Focuses on genetic data privacy and insider threat management.

\- \*\*Home Depot Breach\*\* – Details malware targeting POS systems and vendor access failures.

\- \*\*Lightning Strikes\*\* – Assesses physical risk and business continuity planning.

\- \*\*Pegasus Airlines\*\* – Investigates credential leakage and aviation cybersecurity risks.

\## Personal Reflection



This portfolio segment demonstrated the value of combining structured frameworks with real-world scenarios. Through worksheets and breach case studies, I developed fluency in identifying vulnerabilities, applying threat models like PASTA and PESTEL, and documenting risk in a manner aligned with GRC and compliance operations. These exercises built both technical insight and practical reporting skills that will translate directly into audit, risk, and policy roles.
