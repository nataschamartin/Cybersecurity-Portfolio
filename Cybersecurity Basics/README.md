# Cybersecurity Basics – Critical Thinking & Ethics

## 🧠 Activity: "Would You Rather?"
This exemplar highlights a foundational cybersecurity activity focused on critical thinking, technological ethics, and decision-making under complexity.

Learners were presented with three ethical dilemmas related to privacy, usability, and innovation. For each, we had to choose between two difficult tradeoffs, analyze consequences at personal, societal, and global levels, and justify our position using ethical reasoning.

## 🧩 Scenarios Explored

1. **Privacy vs. Personalization**  
   Would you give up convenience to keep your data private — or trust companies with your data for tailored services?

2. **Security vs. Usability**  
   Would you accept complex security protocols for safety — or prioritize ease of access with basic protections?

3. **Innovation vs. Regulation**  
   Would you support free innovation even with risks — or advocate for strict laws that protect rights but may limit progress?

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Apply critical thinking to ambiguous cybersecurity dilemmas
- Analyze ethical trade-offs and long-term impacts
- Make reasoned decisions grounded in personal values and security principles

## 🔍 Why This Matters
Cybersecurity professionals face constant gray areas — not just technical ones, but ethical ones. This exercise develops the ability to assess real-world consequences and make thoughtful choices in situations with no "right" answer.

*Course: Google Cybersecurity Certificate – Module 1: Cybersecurity Foundations*

IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2024 (Report Review)
Summarized IBM’s annual global threat report. Identified top attack vectors (phishing, credential abuse), targeted sectors (manufacturing, healthcare), and emerging threats (RaaS, LOTL techniques). Connected trends to real-world 2024 incidents and discussed relevance to GRC and compliance roles.

Install Rkhunter (Lab – Troubleshooting Focus)
Attempted to install and run Rkhunter on a lab-based Linux VM. The lab environment ran into persistent package lock errors due to background apt processes, which required manual intervention. I identified and killed the stuck processes, cleared lock files, reconfigured dpkg, and attempted reinstallation. While the install never fully completed, this activity showcased real troubleshooting under broken lab conditions. Screenshots document each step of the process and demonstrate command-line comfort in a Linux setting.

Module 4: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (Activity)
Confirmed that 2FA was already enabled on both Google and Microsoft accounts prior to this lab. Google 2-Step Verification uses Google Authenticator and backup recovery methods, while Microsoft is secured through the Microsoft Authenticator app with push-based verification. Skipped Apple’s 2FA entirely due to its known security quirks and user control issues. Used the activity as a quick audit to ensure backup methods and recovery contacts were still current and functional.

# Final Project – Operating Systems and Security

This file contains my final reflections and task breakdown for the *Operating Systems and Security* course. The final project was designed to simulate real-world system administration responsibilities in both Windows and Linux environments using cloud-based labs.

## 🔧 Project Overview

I was assigned six tickets:

- **Windows Tasks**
  1. Add a new user and group
  2. Run virus and threat protection
  3. Configure firewall and network protection

- **Linux Tasks**
  4. Create a new user
  5. Manage files and folders
  6. Apply system updates

While the course provided cloud-based lab environments for both Windows and Linux, I experienced repeated technical issues that made it impossible to complete the labs interactively. Instead, I documented each task thoroughly, reviewed the intended process, and reflected on the skills involved.

## 🧠 Learning Reflection

Despite the lab challenges, I completed all reading and activity reviews. I now have a strong conceptual understanding of:
- User and group management across OS types
- System maintenance through command line and GUI
- Security tools like antivirus and firewalls
- The differences between Windows and Linux administration

This project also highlighted the importance of reliable lab access when training in technical fields. I intend to recreate many of these tasks locally to build more hands-on confidence.
