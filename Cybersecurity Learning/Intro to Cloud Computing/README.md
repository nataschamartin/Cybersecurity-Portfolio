# Introduction to Cloud Computing

**Provider:** IBM (Coursera / Skills Network)  
**Completion Date:** May 13, 2025

## Course Overview

This course introduced core cloud computing concepts, including service and deployment models, virtualization, containers, and serverless computing. It focused on IBM Cloud services and emphasized hands-on experience through tools like Docker, the IBM Cloud CLI, and IBM Code Engine.

## Key Topics

- Cloud service models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
- Deployment models: public, private, hybrid, multicloud
- Virtual machines, containers, and serverless compute
- Cloud storage and networking foundations
- Compliance and security considerations
- Real-world cloud computing use cases

## Final Project: "Guess the Capital"

This interactive web application required students to:

- Clone the app code (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Containerize the app using Docker
- Tag and push the image to IBM Cloud Container Registry
- Deploy the app to IBM Cloud using Code Engine
- Troubleshoot GUI/CLI and resource targeting issues

The project demonstrated a complete DevOps pipeline: local development, containerization, cloud deployment, and verification.

## Tools Used

- **Docker CLI** – containerization
- **IBM Cloud CLI** – deployment and management
- **Skills Network IDE** – code editing and terminal
- **IBM Code Engine** – serverless container orchestration

## Reflection

This course built practical skills in containerization and deployment, reinforcing key concepts in cloud infrastructure. Troubleshooting CLI-based deployment without full GUI access increased confidence in navigating real-world cloud environments.
