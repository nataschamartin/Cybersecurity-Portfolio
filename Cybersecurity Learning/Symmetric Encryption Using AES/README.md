# 🔐 Symmetric Encryption with AES – OpenSSL Lab

This lab demonstrates symmetric encryption and decryption using the AES algorithm with OpenSSL in a Linux terminal environment. It includes hands-on exercises focused on real-world file encryption workflows, key generation, and secure file handling.

## 📋 Objectives

- Generate AES-256 encryption keys
- Encrypt and decrypt files using `openssl enc` with `aes-256-cbc`
- Use both password file-based and direct hex key/IV methods
- Understand binary encryption output and terminal validation

## 🧪 Tools Used

- OpenSSL
- Linux terminal

## 📁 Lab Contents

- `Lab - Symmetric Encryption Using AES.docx` – Full lab write-up with screenshots and command output
- `Lab - Symmetric Encryption Using AES.pdf` – Optional portfolio version
- Screenshots verifying:
  - Encryption/decryption of plaintext
  - AES key and IV handling
  - Output match before and after decryption

## ✅ Exercises Included

### Exercise 1:
- Encrypt and decrypt `secret_message.txt` using password file-based AES key

### Exercise 2:
- Encrypt and decrypt `credentials.txt` using direct hex key and IV

Both exercises include verification steps and outputs confirming successful decryption and data integrity.
