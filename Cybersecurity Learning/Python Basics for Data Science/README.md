Python Basics for Data Science



This folder contains practice labs, error resolution examples, and learning checkpoints from the Python Basics for Data Science course by IBM on Coursera/Skills Network.



The course provided a hands-on introduction to core Python syntax and logic through Jupyter-based coding exercises. All screenshots, notes, and outputs were completed by Natascha Martin as part of her foundational training in Python for cybersecurity and data science applications.

Python Types

Practice using the type() function to inspect and differentiate data types such as int, float, str, and bool.



Python Loops

Beginner-level while loop tasks with examples like auto-generating employee IDs and printing repeated values.



Python Conditionals

Practice using if, elif, and else to build simple logic branches and decision-making scripts.



Python errors - Name Errors

Screenshots and explanations of undefined variable issues and name resolution problems.



Syntax Errors

Examples of basic syntax problems (missing colons, indentation errors, invalid quotes) and how they were resolved.



File Operations

Reading and writing text files in Python. Includes exercises on appending to files and filtering data.



Jupyter Notebook

Live lab outputs and screenshots of completed exercises using Jupyter in a browser-based environment.



Risk Register

(Optional) Side task or project aligned with early GRC learningâ€”may involve structured data handling using lists or dictionaries.
