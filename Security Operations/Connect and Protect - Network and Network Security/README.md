# Connect and Protect â€“ Network and Network Security

**Provider:** Google (Coursera)  
**Completion Date:** May 31, 2025

## Course Summary

This course introduced the foundational concepts of computer networking and the core principles behind securing those systems. It emphasized how networks communicate using protocols, how threats can be identified through log monitoring, and how security frameworks like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) can be applied to triage and respond to security incidents.

## Key Topics

- TCP/IP architecture and network protocols
- Firewalls, VPNs, and segmentation
- Suspicious activity detection through network logs
- Security risk assessments and reporting
- Use of incident response playbooks and flowcharts
- NIST-CSF implementation for structured incident handling

## Hands-On Work

- **SIEM Log Analysis**: Final assignment simulating real-world SIEM queries  
- **Security Incident Report**: Documented and assessed a sample cyberattack  
- **Incident Response Playbook**: Custom playbook and flowchart based on a scenario  
- **Risk Assessment**: Detailed breakdown of network risks and remediation steps  
- **Network Monitoring Exercise**: Identified cyberattacks using traffic logs  
- **Splunk-Based Queries**: Recreated lab assignments using Splunk Cloud due to Coursera lab lockouts

## Personal Notes

Although the course labs were locked, I replicated the exercises using my own tools and platforms. This strengthened my adaptability and ensured I still gained hands-on experience with triage, documentation, and reporting workflows.
