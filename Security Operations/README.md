Incident Response ‚Äì Course Artifacts
This folder includes artifacts from the Incident Response coursework completed as part of my cybersecurity training through EdX and affiliated platforms.

‚úÖ Course Overview
Platform: EdX

Focus: Understanding the lifecycle of incident response, from preparation and detection to containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned

Application: Critical for roles in SOC, threat detection, digital forensics, and compliance

üì∏ Contents
Screenshots \& Notes (if applicable):

Example workflows and ticketing steps for managing security incidents

System log analysis or command-line tools used in triage

Response strategies based on NIST 800-61

(Screenshots placed here reflect personal application of procedures, CLI usage, or lab simulations involving simulated security breaches or mitigation tasks.)

üéØ Why This Matters
Effective incident response is key for:

Minimizing the impact of cyber attacks

Maintaining regulatory compliance

Ensuring business continuity

Feeding lessons learned into security operations and GRC planning

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Demonstrated (if shown)
CLI for Linux or Windows system interrogation

Basic ticketing simulations

Log analysis and user account audit practices



&nbsp;Incident Response \& Digital Forensics Project

This folder contains my final project for the Incident Response and Digital Forensics course. The work is grounded in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and demonstrates practical knowledge of how to detect, respond to, and investigate security incidents.



üîç What's Inside

Incident Response Plan and Digital Forensics Investigation Steps.docx:

A structured plan covering detection, containment, recovery, and post-incident activities based on NIST phases. Includes role assignments, monitoring techniques, documentation strategies, and review processes.



Solution Document\_NM.docx:

My full assignment submission with detailed responses to course prompts. This version removes instructional text and reflects a real-world voice for incident response documentation.



Lab - Investigate Logs using Cowrie.pdf:

A hands-on lab investigation into SSH honeypot logs using Cowrie, demonstrating forensic log analysis in a Linux environment.



Incident Response and Digital Forensics Notes and Quizzes.docx:

Personal notes and quiz answers from the course to reinforce key concepts around malware behavior, evidence collection, and response frameworks.



üí° Key Takeaways

Documented the full incident lifecycle using the NIST model.



Identified and analyzed multiple types of digital evidence.



Developed containment and recovery strategies for spear-phishing malware.



Built a reusable response plan that could be adapted across organizations.



üìÅ Skills Demonstrated

Incident detection \& monitoring



Forensics documentation



Evidence preservation \& integrity validation



Use of log analysis tools (e.g., Cowrie)



Role-based response planning



Compliance with NIST 800-61 guidelines
