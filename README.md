## About Me



I‚Äôm pursuing certifications in cybersecurity, digital forensics, compliance, and project management. This portfolio reflects my hands-on learning and core strengths in cyber law and GRC (governance, risk, compliance).



Notes



All screenshots, documents, and exemplars are original work or captured directly from my own participation in hands-on labs.



Folders are structured to reflect career-aligned learning goals in GRC, digital forensics, incident response, and cloud security.



README files are being added as content is finalized. If a folder is missing a README.md, it will be added soon.
