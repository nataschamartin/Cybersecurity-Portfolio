Optional Lab: DES Cryptanalysis Using CrypTool 2.1
📁 Location
technical-assignments/Lab - DES Cryptanalysis.docx

🧠 Overview
This lab demonstrates the cryptanalysis of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) using the CrypTool 2.1 graphical interface. It explores vulnerabilities in symmetric encryption through Known Plaintext and Ciphertext-Only attack simulations.

🔐 Techniques Demonstrated
🔹 Known Plaintext Attack
Selected Cryptanalysis > Modern Encryption > Symmetric Encryption > DES > Known Plaintext

CrypTool used a known portion of the original message to derive the encryption key

Successfully returned deciphered output and key candidates

🔹 Ciphertext-Only Attack (Exercise)
Reran the cryptanalysis with no plaintext input

CrypTool guessed potential keys and partial message outputs based only on the encrypted data

Demonstrated lower accuracy but showed feasibility of brute-force attacks against DES

📸 Screenshots Included
CrypTool setup process

DES analysis screens

Final output showing decrypted text and key candidates for both attack types

🧾 Summary
This lab highlights the weaknesses of older symmetric encryption methods like DES, especially when short keys or predictable input are used. Using CrypTool provided insight into how cryptanalysis tools can compromise encrypted messages through automation and pattern recognition.
