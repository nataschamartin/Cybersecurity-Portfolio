Python Practice

This folder contains early exercises and troubleshooting examples from my Python for Data Science coursework. These examples were completed using Jupyter Notebooks and Pyodide during beginner-level labs. Most screenshots and activities were taken from the IBM "Python for Data Science" course.

Topics Covered

Python TypesUsing the type() function to inspect data types like int, float, and str.
