Introduction to SQL ‚Äì Course Artifacts
This folder contains practical work and exercises from the Introduction to SQL course completed via EdX. These materials demonstrate foundational SQL query skills relevant to cybersecurity, data analysis, and incident investigation workflows.

‚úÖ Course Overview
Platform: EdX

Focus: Basic SQL queries, filtering, aggregation, and table joins

Application: Useful for forensic analysis, log querying, user behavior analysis, and compliance audits

üì∏ Contents (Screenshots & Exercises)
Each screenshot demonstrates applied SQL concepts, including:

SELECT statements and filtering (WHERE, LIKE, IN)

Sorting and ordering results (ORDER BY)

Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)

Grouping and conditional logic (GROUP BY, HAVING)

Joins across multiple tables (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)

These examples were completed using real lab data within the course environment.

üéØ Why This Matters
SQL is a critical tool for cybersecurity professionals. It allows you to:

Query log data in SIEMs (e.g., Splunk, Azure Sentinel)

Investigate abnormal login activity or access anomalies

Extract evidence from structured datasets during incident response

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
SQL Lab Simulators

Query Testing Environments (via browser-based course platforms)
